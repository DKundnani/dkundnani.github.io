in human genome</a></h3>
<p><br> <img src="images\human_ribome_2025.PNG?raw=true"/> <br><br>
Study of ribonucleotide embedment in human CD4+T cell type derived from
patient blood and lab grown stem cell line (hESC-H9) and embryonic
kidney cells (HEK293T), the latter with and without RNase H2 enzyme. In
this study we discovered single embedded ribonucleotides (rNMPs) are
enriched near CpG islands and are associated with gene expression and
methylation around Transcription Start Sites (TSSs). In addition, we see
a gene template vs non-template strand bias for RNase H2 KO that is not
present in wild-type RNase H2 cell associated with removal of rG on
non-template strand, possibly by Top1 enzyme.</p>

Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS) orthologous mutants</a> <br>
<img src="images\AGS_final.PNG?raw=true"/> <br><br> Two mutant orthologs
of human AGS, namely RNaseH2A-G37S and RNaseH2C-R69W were experimentally
created in yeast as rnh201-G42S and rnh203-K46W, respectively. The
RNaseH2A mutant results in strong reduction of enzymes activity thereby
leading to massive ribonucleotide increament in the nuclear genome with
increase seen on leading strand of Autonomous Replicating Sequences. The
RNase H2C mutant was found to show no significant increase in nuclear
genome, but we observed change in sites of ribonucleotide embedment
suggesting structural effect of enzyme leading to change in
specificity.</th>

Discovery of Differntially methylated regions in smokers vs non smokers
validated the finding from several other research groups. We were able
to see variation in the methylation status based on Race. For prognosis
prediction on this <a

Aging Cohort (VACS) Index</a>. Use of support Vector Machines gave the
best accuracy. Used of different and more lineant thresholding to
extract more features and more information could lead to good AUCs for
the methylated regions to be used as Biomarkers or predictors. <a
